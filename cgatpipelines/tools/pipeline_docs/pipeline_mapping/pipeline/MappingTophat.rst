Mapping reads with tophat_ across splice-junctions is the first step in the RNASeq 
analysis pipeline. The following table present an overview of tophat results for 
each :term:`track`.

   Tophat results

.. note:: 

   Unmapped reads are not carried over into subsequence analyses, hence the number
   of input and mapped reads will be the same. Only the latter is shown.
