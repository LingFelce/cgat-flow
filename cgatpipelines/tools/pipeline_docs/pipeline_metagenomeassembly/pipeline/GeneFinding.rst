Predicting genes in contigs
=============================

A major aim of metagenomics analysis is to identify and quantify the functional
capacity of the community. In the following sections we use software to predict 
the presence of open reading frames in the assembly.

These are solely predictions and do not provided information on the functional 
roles of the predicted genes.
